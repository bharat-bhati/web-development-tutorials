      Getting lost in 'hyperspace' The easy linking of different fragments of
      information crucial for browsing can produce hypertext documents that are
      very difficult to use. The user may become disoriented when they do not
      know where they are in the document and where he can go to. This problem
      of navigating a hypertext network is also known as being 'lost in
      hyperspace'. There are ways to minimise the risks of being lost in such a
