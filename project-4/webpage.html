      this is my first web page a project by apna college .Web development
      refers to the building, creating, and maintaining of websites. It includes
      aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database
      management. It is the creation of an application that works over the
      internet i.e. websites.The word Web Development is made up of two words,
      that is: Web: It refers to websites, web pages or anything that works over
      the internet. Development: Building the application from scratch.

      Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the
      Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web
      development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain
      text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social
      network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web
      development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web
      content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting,
      Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
      Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main
      non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2]
      Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content
      changes easier and available with basic technical skills. For larger
      organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of
      hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile
      methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only
      require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary
      assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or
      information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative
      effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated
      department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization:
      front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3]
      Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in
      the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since
      the commercialization of the Web with Tim Berners-Lee[4] developing the
      World Wide Web at CERN, the industry has boomed and has become one of the
      most used technologies ever.

      Development of "open source" receives very little attention especially
      official concerns by the initial founders for its development. The initial
      organizations to benefit from the open licensing systems directly included
      the Department of Defence (DOD), Research Agencies, and the Lab
      researchers such as National Laboratories (Reece et al, 92). These
      organizations were the most viable producers, users and beneficiaries of
      the licensing operation. The firms also provided the platform for major
      advances such as the firewalls, and other network security tools. Open
      licensing therefore caused firms to merge ideas and integrate development
      of operating systems and related software to high-tech but inexpensive
      software/hardware supercomputers to replace the original Pentium-based
      systems. Although departments such as the DOD or Space Agencies may have
      developed or initiated most of the research into open source, in overall,
      today's beneficiaries include commercial agencies. Commercial enterprises
      such as Netscape, Red Hat, Cygnus, MacAfee and Caldera were quick to
      realize the opportunities offered by web-based methodologies and begun to
      offer the open source arrangements. Other firms that latter on came in
      support of open source included the hardware developers such as Dell,
      Hewlett-Packard, Compaq, Sun Microsystems and IBM (International Business
      Machines) among others. Consistent with VanDyk, the concept open source
      emerged from software engineers, but today the entire movement is made of
      technologically motivated individuals (9). They focus more on
      technological productivity as opposed to economical benefits.

      Software developers have often engaged and appreciated the open source
      form of programming due to easiness on implementation of aspects that
      initially seemed to conflict such as reliability, innovativeness and
      interoperability. Internet community ought to value creativity and
      efficiency and ensure that accomplishments are not redone/duplicated but
      rather improved. Good open source software incorporates other common data
      formats, and these forms of reuse and refinement have previously enhanced
      development of quality and unique software. There are various debates
      based on open source especially envisioning future prospects of the field
      of sharing codes. The current research studies on the matter provide only
      a glimpse of the facts and fail to expound on the possible pedagogy and
      technological changes.

      Although the initial authors retain all the rights of their code,
      restrictions are less and simpler to allow others to utilize the code.
      Today, different countries have constitutions supporting the freedom of
      speech. Users never thought programs would be freeware in a manner
      comparable to the way verbal communication is an inalienable right today.
      Redistribution of software code does not face unnecessary restriction,
      since developers found that open source is an effective way of finding and
      correcting faulty codes. Open source also encourages reliability and
      quality of software due to the independent reviews and the rapid dynamic
      nature of the web-based programming. According to Van Reijswoud, the
      simplified way of defining open source may appear more pervasive compared
      to technical definition (230). The open form of licensing allows any
      individual developer as well as a corporation to give others freedom to
      change competence and quality of a code, at the same time retain ownership
      as long as the beneficiaries agree to equally share the code with others
      under similar terms of agreement. This form of web development allows
      development of new web programmers particularly among users who wish to
      make their contributions on success and quality of products. Web
      development has therefore advanced to allow better distribution of
      expertise through refinement of existing codes. Experts are also able to
      provide new services through innovation and inspired creations. The new
      trend of user-developer enhances development of diverse and advanced
      modern websites. Open source therefore allows a progressive form of
      dynamism that is almost impossible to achieve given any other condition
      that developers may find (Meeker, 38). There is a revolution on the way
      the software engineering industry has developed in terms software quality
      and ability to assist beneficiaries from the developments. it has a
      foundation of functionality and practical knowledge (81). Technology
      maturity has thus caused spreading of knowledge and enhancement of
      techniques. Programmers are ready and more willing to have their codes
      examined, verified and used by others. Allowing others to use the code is
      mostly based on utmost good faith that the favour will be replicated or
      returned as opposed to financial benefits. Employers of excellent
      source-code providers such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
      Sun Microsystems, IBM and other corporations also have a direct benefit of
      fame, recognition and demand for goods or services. Their products are a
      direct reflection of business personality, capabilities, and the
      collaborative nature. The use of ad hoc organizations has assisted in
      great developments, for instance the Apache Group were able to build up
      the most popular server “World Wide Web”, without ever convening. Working
      partners such as the Berkeley Software developers in-charge of commercial
      firewalls have employees working from various locations and collaborate
      electronically. Open licensing therefore allows organizations to pull
      web-based initiatives together and ensure survival of best products
      without disenfranchising anyone. Programmers are becoming smarter to
      ensure production of the best and greatest codes compared to potential
      competitors. The easiness of obtaining the source code is also a great
      inspiration and a guide for many initial code developers especially web
      designers. An author of a code can find feedback such as suggestions or
      criticisms from other users and this is vital for systems productivity.
      Companies such as Microsoft can also be able to find the open-source teams
      and expand their capabilities indefinitely since such measure is global
      and allows full-time international interactions. In line with Koch, open
      source enables a firm to ensure continuous use, maintenance and
      enhancement of a product (5). They must be able to integrate change on
      future developments to ensure competitive investment. The systems are able
      to harness sustainability, through collaboration of users and developers.
